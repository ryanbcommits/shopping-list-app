##Connecting the frontend to a DB
I solely want to establish a connection to the vsCode-2025 db I created.
After that is successful I want to submit data to it after.


##Button works!
Now that the button is responsive to js in the console, let us see if I can get it to connect to my db. If so I can build from there!
created a separate db.js file to house the database logic.

##Success!
I successfully connected to the Realtime Database with read and write functionality. Turns out with js the Realtime DB is more compatable...
