# Connecting the Frontend to a Database

Building off of the code I created that establishes a connection to a Firestore database on a button click, I plan to build off of the foundation and make this more complex. I was successful at hard coding data into the async method in the db.js file to get the data to be written and later read by the console.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanbcommits/shopping-list-app.git
   cd shopping-list-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
4. Run Development server

  


## Development Setup

**To get the project running in dev mode:**
```bash
npx vite
```


Then open your browser to the localhost URL that Vite provides (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

**To close project in dev mode:**
```bash
Ctrl + c
```

## AI Disclosure

As AI is being used more and more with coding, my goal is to leverage LLMs - in this case Claude - to provide me with supplemental knowledge if I run into roadblocks.

**Method:** Code first and attempt to accomplish my goal without AI. If I run into a roadblock where I would typically have used Google or Stack Overflow, I am using Claude to help me work through the problem. The overall purpose of this exercise is to leverage AI to speed up my learning, not to use it as a shortcut.

**How I Use AI:**
- As a tutor to explain concepts I don't understand
- To debug error messages when stuck
- To learn best practices and security improvements
- To understand differences between similar methods (like setDoc vs addDoc)

**What's My Own Work:**
- All initial code attempts and logic
- Project structure and design decisions  
- Problem-solving approach
- Implementation of learned concepts

## Development Notes

Some Firebase authentication logic was developed with assistance from Claude AI.

## Key Learnings

### JavaScript Concepts
- **Event Listeners**: Learned about DOMContentLoaded and why scripts need to wait for HTML
- **Async/Await**: Understanding asynchronous operations with Firebase
- **Scope**: Fixed function scope issues by moving reusable functions outside event listeners

### Firebase Skills
- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and session management
- **Firestore**: Difference between setDoc() vs addDoc(), soft delete patterns
- **Data Structure**: Organizing user-specific data with proper hierarchy

## How The App Works

1. User registers/logs in (login.js handles authentication)
2. Redirects to home.html after successful login
3. Shopping list loads from Firestore (user-specific data)
4. User can add items (stores in Firestore with timestamp)
5. User can delete items (soft delete - marks as hidden)
6. Data persists across sessions

## Features
- Multiple authentication methods (Email/Password and Google Sign-In)
- Real-time data synchronization with Firestore
- Automatic session timeout for security
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Soft delete for data recovery
- Responsive error handling with visual feedback


**6/9/25** - After attempting to have two HTML pages utilize a shared .js file, I ran into a problem. I suspected that there was an issue with having two HTML pages calling the same JavaScript file. I consulted Claude and it said that my JS was running before the HTML elements are loaded, so when my script runs, the DOM elements don't exist yet (`document.getElementById("connect")` returns null). The quick fix was to wrap the code in `DOMContentLoaded`.

**7/1/25**
- Register button must be inside the form for submit events (unless you create a variable for the button itself)
- Modal elements are accessible via getElementById even when hidden
- Firebase auth errors are clearer with proper error.code logging
- Deleted register.js since the code was used in login.js instead

**7/8/25**
- Fixed the user experience after registration, the app takes them to index.html
- Found a small bug in the code that allowed the user to click outside the modal which is not desirable for registration purposes, so I commented out code which was allowing the user to hide the modal on click events outside the modal.

**7/26/25**
- Added password validation at registration

**7/30/25**
- Successfully implemented user-specific data storage using Firebase UID
- Added visual feedback system - submitted data now populates in a dynamic list
- Improved user experience with form clearing after successful submission
- Learned the difference between setDoc() and addDoc() for document creation
- Implemented proper data structure organization (users collection with individual user documents)

**8/3/25**
- Successfully implemented dynamic list display with a relational (NoSQL) database - Cloud Firestore -  loading using getDocs()
- Added authentication state management with onAuthStateChanged() - users now see their existing data when logging back in
- Implemented user-specific data persistence - list items now survive page reloads and logout/login cycles
- Added personalized welcome message using template literals with user.email
- Learned difference between getDoc() (single) vs getDocs() (multiple documents)
- Fixed function scope issues by moving reusable functions outside event listeners
- TODO: Add delete functionality for list items and transition to shopping list format

**8/12/25**
- Implemented soft delete functionality using updateDoc() instead of permanent deletion
- Added "hidden" field to database documents to preserve data while removing from user view
- Learned difference between hard delete (deleteDoc) vs soft delete (updateDoc with hidden flag)
- Successfully filtered hidden items from display using conditional logic in loadUserData()
- Chose DOM element creation approach (createElement) over complex template literal event handling
- Improved code readability by separating HTML creation from event listener attachment
- Database now preserves all user data while maintaining clean user interface experience

**8/17/25**
- Included first name and last name at point of registration
- Changed code to be more in line with a shopping list app
- Added Enter key support with preventDefault() to stop form refresh
- Learned about strict equality (===) vs loose equality (==)
- Understood difference between DOM, document, and window objects

**8/18/25**
- Implemented comprehensive security improvements with environment variables for Firebase config
- Added rate limiting to prevent spam (1 second cooldown between submissions)
- Fixed XSS vulnerability by replacing innerHTML with textContent for user input
- Added inactivity timeout with warning (logs out after 15 minutes, warns at 14 minutes)
- Implemented loading states for better UX when adding items
- Added input validation for item name length (50 character limit)
- Fixed Enter key support to prevent form submission page refresh
- Added user feedback for all error states
- Learned about JavaScript constants vs enums and naming conventions
- Understood TypeScript influences on JavaScript conventions (ALL_CAPS for constants)

**8/20/25**
- Created password policy in Firebase requiring uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters
- Implemented frontend password validation using for loops to check each character
- Added visual error messages in modal instead of using alerts for better UX
- Learned about ASCII values and how character comparisons work in JavaScript
- Fixed syntax errors and improved error handling in registration flow

**8/21/25**
- Implemented Google Sign-In authentication using signInWithPopup
- Added user profile creation for first-time Google sign-ins  
- Learned about optional chaining operator (?) as shorthand for checking if properties exist
- Completed the setTimeout implementation for 15-minute inactivity logout
- Discovered difference between firebase-config.js (setup) vs importing Firestore functions where needed

**8/24/25**
- Updated package.json file and prepared for first production deployment
- Successfully deployed beta version to personal domain for testing
- Resolved build issues with Firebase environment variables in production
- Identified mobile compatibility issues on iOS Chrome - investigated solutions and likely resolved with resolving the build issue in the statement above.
- Released first MVP with core shopping list functionality! ðŸŽ‰

## Challenges Overcome

- **Problem**: Enter key refreshing the page instead of adding items
  - **Solution**: Added preventDefault() in keypress event listener

- **Problem**: XSS vulnerability with innerHTML
  - **Solution**: Switched to createElement and textContent approach

- **Problem**: Users staying logged in indefinitely
  - **Solution**: Implemented inactivity timer with warning system
