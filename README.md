##Connecting the frontend to a DB
Building off of the code I created that establishes a connection to a firestore db on a button click I plan to build off of the foundation and make this more complex.

I was sucessful at hard coding data into the async method in the db.js file to get the data to be written and later read by the console. 

## Known Issues
- [✅] Figure out how to isolate just a name to print to the console
- [✅] Get form data to write to the database
- 

## TODO
- Have multiple submissions create new documents in the database
- Have the info from the db print to the window
- Improve user experience
